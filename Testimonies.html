I struggled with confidence, feeling inferior, especially in situations like having to do a presentation. I had an issue with my health (bleeding) that was worrying me.

My coach and I worked on emotional clearing for issues from my past, which even helped normalize my health. We used strategic visioning techniques—like vividly imagining myself in that black dress or in my future happy life with a family—to set those goals deeply in my unconscious mind. I learned about interdependence, so I can aim for a relationship where I don't lose myself. The key was doing the work first in my imagination."</div>

                    <div class="section-content">"I was in a cycle of exhaustion and emotional overwhelm, especially in my professional life. I was faced with an unsustainable 16-hour workday with no support, which led to a total meltdown—crying uncontrollably for an hour. I felt helpless, taken advantage of, and deeply alone. In my personal life, I was pacifying loneliness by holding onto memories of a past connection, because reaching out for a real, present relationship felt too risky and likely to lead to disappointment."</div>

                    <div class="section-content">"In this session with my coach, I learned about the concept of Shadow Values—the hidden drivers behind my actions. We discovered that a core shadow value for me is Righteousness: my deep need to do the 'right' thing and be someone who can be counted on, no matter the cost. I also uncovered that my actions often come with an unspoken expectation of Reciprocity and Validation. I realized that my intense reaction came from this expectation being shattered when I asked for help and didn't receive it. Furthermore, I saw how I use memories as a 'coping fiction' to avoid the vulnerability of seeking current connection."</div>

                    <div class="section-content">"The biggest result was clarity. Naming these shadow values—Righteousness and the need for Reciprocal Acknowledgment—allowed me to understand my own patterns. Instead of just feeling helpless or resentful, I now see the underlying mechanics. I understand why I push myself to the brink and why I feel so let down when support isn't mutual. This awareness is the first and most powerful step. I no longer see my breakdown as just a moment of weakness, but as crucial data. I feel equipped to start working with these parts of myself, to ensure they serve me rather than lead me into exhaustion. I have a diagnostic tool for my life."</div>

I learned to distinguish between judgment and discernment, and to protect my inner child instead of judging him. Joshua and I worked on mentally rehearsing the future I wanted—like visualizing a full day, a week, even a month with my desired outcomes. I applied this by engaging in childlike play with a mature perspective, like planning a fun, romantic future trip to Oktoberfest with a future partner, and by focusing on my childhood passions to fuel my contribution."</div>

                    <div class="section-content">"I learned that my reactive behavior was connected to much older pain from childhood trauma. Through a guided process, I connected with my inner child from before the trauma, offered him love and safety, and integrated that healed part into my heart.

I now carry a deep sense of safety and protection within. Instead of being hijacked by old triggers, I feel a new pause and a conscious choice in how I respond. I am building a new identity where 'I am peace and stability' is my truth. I now believe we can create a relationship filled with loving, creative interactions, and I can finally see a future where we look back with a sense of quality and healing."</div>

                    <div class="section-content">"I had done a lot of personal development work, but I was still carrying specific hurts and resentments from past incidents. I also struggled with fear—some rational, some that felt irrational and limiting. I found it hard to even identify and connect with specific emotional incidents from my past, as I had a habit of pushing feelings down. When trying to process things, I sometimes felt stuck, like I was holding onto emotions because letting go might open me up to something else I feared."</div>

                    <div class="section-content">"I learned the 'Space Odyssey' technique, where you create immense distance from a painful memory to drain its emotional charge, then reprogram it with empowering learnings using color, sound, and feeling. I also applied the rapid 'spinning' technique, where you pull the emotional energy out of your body, spin it in the opposite direction to transform it, and put it back in. The biggest insight was that I didn't have to do the process perfectly as taught; I could enhance it with my own symbolism—like adding a phoenix rising from the ashes to the gray room technique—making it even more powerful for me."</div>

                    <div class="section-content">"Using the Space Odyssey process, I was able to take specific incidents of guilt and hurt and reduce their emotional charge to zero. It felt messy at times, but it worked better than any intellectual analysis I'd tried before. With the spinning technique, I felt a profound physical shift—the energy moved through my entire body. A fear that was at a high level dropped significantly, and I felt very free afterwards. These tools gave me a sense of agency; they are my new 'superpower' for dealing with old wounds quickly and effectively, not just talking about them forever."</div>
